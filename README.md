# vscodex README

Visual Studio Code extension to support new codex API by OpenAI.

An access is required in order to use the API. This access is granted through an **API key** and the key must be in the environment variable as `OPEN_AI_API_KEY`.

```
echo 'export OPEN_AI_API_KEY=********' >> ~/.bashrc
```

## Features

For now there is only one command:\
"OpenAI - Complete snippet" `vscodex.predict`
